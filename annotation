TreeFigure
String form: <ivy.vis.tree.TreeFigure object at 0x124d5c710>
File:        /anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ivy/vis/tree.py
Docstring:  
Window for showing a single tree, optionally with split overview
and detail panes.

The navigation toolbar at the bottom is provided by matplotlib
(http://matplotlib.sf.net/users/navigation_toolbar.html).  Its
pan/zoom button and zoom-rectangle button provide different modes
of mouse interaction with the figure.  When neither of these
buttons are checked, the default mouse bindings are as follows:

* button 1 drag: select nodes - retrieve by calling fig.selected_nodes
* button 3 drag: pan view
* scroll up/down: zoom in/out
* scroll up/down with Control key: zoom y-axis
* scroll up/down with Shift key: zoom x-axis
* scroll up/down with 'd' key: pan view up/down
* scroll up/down with 'e' key: pan view left/right
* click on overview will center the detail pane on that region
#enter q for quit
