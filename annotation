TreeFigure
String form: <ivy.vis.tree.TreeFigure object at 0x124d5c710>
File:        /anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ivy/vis/tree.py
Docstring:  
Window for showing a single tree, optionally with split overview
and detail panes.
1The navigation toolbar at the bottom is provided by matplotlib
(http://matplotlib.sf.net/users/navigation_toolbar.html).  Its
pan/zoom button and zoom-rectangle button provide different modes
of mouse interaction with the figure.  When neither of these
buttons are checked, the default mouse bindings are as follows:

* button 1 drag: select nodes - retrieve by calling fig.selected_nodes
* button 3 drag: pan view
* scroll up/down: zoom in/out
* scroll up/down with Control key: zoom y-axis
* scroll up/down with Shift key: zoom x-axis
* scroll up/down with 'd' key: pan view up/down
* scroll up/down with 'e' key: pan view left/right
* click on overview will center the detail pane on that region
Default keybindings:

* t: zoom out to full extent
* +/-: zoom in/out

Useful attributes and methods (assume an instance named *fig*):

* fig.root - the root node (see [Node methods])
* fig.highlight(s) - highlight and trace nodes with substring *s*
* fig.zoom_clade(anc) - zoom to view node *anc* and all its descendants
* fig.toggle_overview() - toggle visibility of the overview pane
* fig.toggle_branchlabels() - ditto for branch labels
* fig.toggle_leaflabels() - ditto for leaf labels
* fig.decorate(func) - decorate the tree with a function (see
  :ref:`decorating TreeFigures <decorating-trees>`)
